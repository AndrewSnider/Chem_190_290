# CHEM 190/290 — Data Science in Chemistry  
**Spring 2026 | UC Merced**

Welcome!   
This repository is your home for CHEM 190/290. You’ll find lecture notebooks, labs, homework templates, and project materials used throughout the semester.

##  What This Course Is About

This course is hands-on and project-focused. We’ll learn how to work with **chemical data** using modern data science tools, with an emphasis on:

- Python & Jupyter Notebooks  
- Data analysis and visualization  
- Basic statistics and machine learning  
- Reading and understanding data-driven chemistry research  

No prior machine learning experience is required—just curiosity and willingness to experiment.

## 📂 Course Directory Layout

If you are seeing this page, then you are most likely running a personal JupyterHub instance for this course in your browser. Every time you launch an instance (i.e. click on the provided link), the remote course directory maintained by the instructors is synced to ***your personal JupyterHub account*** - this means you are free to edit any notebooks or other files without worrying about affecting other students. This is the overall file structure for the course home directory

```
.
├── Lectures/    # Lecture content & demos
├── Homework/    # Homework assignments
├── Projects/    # Mini-projects & final project information
├── Datasets/    # Course datasets (do not modify)
├── Chem290Resources.pdf # Short list of programming / data science resourses from previous year
└── README.md    # This file, essentially course home page
```

 ***If you accidently delete a file, you can simply close and relaunch the JupyterHub instance***. Any missing files will automatically be added back to your directory. You shouldn't need to create any files yourself (may change when we get to projects), but if you do they will persist in your user directory even after closing and relaunching the instance.

##  How to Use JupyterHub

 Behind the scenes, your JupyterHub instance is running on a cloud server hosted by the UC Merced CIRT team - we reccomend students at least briefly read through the Usage Policy the CIRT team has for these instances https://ucm-it.github.io/hpc_docs/docs/jupyter/jupyterhub-policy

All Jupyter Notebooks we will work on in this class are self-contained and ready to edit. Just navigate to the appropiate notebook and begin writing your own code.

##  Software You’ll Use

All work is done in **Python** using Jupyter Notebooks. Common packages include:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

Everything you need is already available on JupyterHub—no local installation required.
